# Deep Learning-Based Hyperbolic Fuzzy Rough Sets (DL-HFRS) for Wind Turbine Health Monitoring

This repository contains the implementation of the **DL-HFRS framework**, which integrates entropy-driven hyperbolic fuzzy rough sets with deep learning for wind turbine health monitoring using SCADA data.

## üìå Features
- Entropy-weighted hyperbolic fuzzy rough set model
- Deep learning integration (MLP/LSTM)
- Fuzzy labels (0.0, 0.5, 1.0) for uncertainty-aware prediction
- SHAP explainability for feature interpretation
