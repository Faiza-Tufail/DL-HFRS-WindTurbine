## 📌 Overview  

Wind turbines are critical components of modern renewable energy infrastructure. However, unexpected failures, high maintenance costs, and downtime pose significant challenges. This project addresses these issues by combining:  

- **Hyperbolic Fuzzy Rough Sets (HFRS):** A powerful mathematical framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision.  
- **Relational Entropy Measures:** To enhance interpretability and decision transparency.  
- **Deep Learning Models:** For robust feature extraction and predictive analysis.  

The integration of these methods provides a **novel, interpretable, and high-performance health monitoring model**.
